Everything runs in the frontend, make sure to have all the JSON stuff in `output.json`.

# TODO:

make default colour scheme dark, add light mode slider. (tried on gpt but didn't work, try again with better prompt maybe)

Make it so that next to the letters of the alphabet you have a selector that shows the tags. you can click the tag to add it to your search, and can add as many as you want. adding multiple tags shold act as a logical AND (i.e. "Mains" and "Pieds" shold not be able to be selected at the same time since there it makes no sense. or Couleur and Mains since no technique has both.)
